Code to use the low-level ALSA drivers to play sound effects with very low
latency (and a high level of control)

As of this writing, this code compiles, but it would be a miracle if it ran.
It's not finished and I don't know whether it's even going to be used (if 
we can use a higher-level Python interface for this, we should) but I'm adding
it to github in case we need to work with it.
